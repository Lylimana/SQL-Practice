This project will house my SQL pratice in preparation for future projects. 

My goal with this project is to develop a strong understanding of SQL and its applications.
I want to achieve a fluency and ability to apply my learned knowledge into real world scenarios.

The course I am following for practicing and learning mySQL is Alex The Analysts video 'Learn SQL Beginner to Advanced in Under 4 Hours'.
